This app provides playing Youtube videos and synchronized captions. I use it to train English listening and memory vocabulary.
I made this side project in 2021, including UI design and frontend development.
- Connect Youtube APIs to get captions.
- Using Microsoft Azure translation API to translate words to Chinese.
- Built this project as mobile app with PWA.
