This app provides playing Youtube videos and synchronized captions. I use it to train English listening and memorize vocabulary.
I made this side project in 2021, including UI design and frontend development.
- Built a PWA app for synchronized YouTube playback with captions and vocabulary training.
- Integrated YouTube APIs translation API for real-time english captions.
- Rebuilt in 2025 by replacing backend services with Google Apps Script, storing transcripts in Google Sheets as a lightweight database.
- Tech: React.js (PWA), YouTube API, Google Apps Script
